1. One Time Pad Cipher - you have a message and the key is list of numbers that is same length as the message. Each character in the message is shifted by its corresponding number in the key. 

2. Caesar Cipher - you have a message and a key - a number. Each character in the message is shifted by the number. A and shift of 4 becomes D.

3. Gronsfeld Cipher - you have a message, the key is a list of numbers. Each character is shifted by a number in the key, when you reach the end of the key, you go back to the start.

4. Vignere Cipher - you have a message, the key is word or phrase. Each letter in the key, is a shift. E.g. B - shift of 1. C - shift of 2.
Each character in the message is shifted by the shift represented by the letter in the key. When you reach the end of the key, you go back to the start.

key = 'cat' =   [3, 0, 19]
message = dogs are great

d + 3, o + 0, g + 19     s + 3 a + 0
